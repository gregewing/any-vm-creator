# any-vm-creator
Use to create guest VMs so that they can be run inside docker containers.  Using this, you can install any OS you like and have it run in a docker container on your linux docker host.

I'll add more detail in time.

This is really just a holding place for more documentation and detail to be added later.
The meat of the documentation is on docker hub.

Please raise any questions or issues here.
